    What are the options to improve the experience of a Human VS Human game play?
    instead of selecting first of all all the hands for the current round and than checking the winner of the total round.
    i would check after each selection of the current round who is the winner.

    a. What is a proper way of dealing with a crash?
        surrounding the fetch blocks with try and catch, where the catch will log the error, and also return an empty result.
        i would also use with the function returning a promise a reject response and the function calling those will be surounding by try/catch
    
    b. What is a proper way of dealing with a situation where the app was closed in the middle of a game? 
        I would Use localStorage, sessionStorage, or IndexedDB to check for saved data of the last interaction.
        So when we trigger the game again it will ask to resume the last game and if so reload all the previus content.

    c.entire game to be played round by round in a CPU player VS CPU player game?
        since we are using async function to create a random hand for each cpu player and waiting for it to finish for each player using the keyword await.
        i would try to use Promise.All to create the hands for the cpu so that creating the hands wont wait for one to finish before triggering the other one.
        and instead running both of them at the same time.
